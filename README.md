# AtverterH-Based MPPT Controller
(docs/images/interface.jpg)

This project consists of code for two primary components:
- An MPPT controller program running on an AtverterH programmable DC-DC converter
- A web interface displaying data from the MPPT controller, running on a Raspberry Pi 

## MPPT Controller
(docs/images/testing.jpg)

The MPPT controller implements an incremental conductance (IC) algorithm running on an ATMEGA328p built into the AtverterH board.

The program ```src/AtverterH_MPPT.cpp``` requires all of the libraries in the ```lib``` folder, as well as ```AnalogReadFast``` from the Arduino Library Manager.

This file must then be flashed to the ATMEGA chip for full MPPT operation.

This program was tested with a 24V solar panel on the high side terminals, and a 12V battery on the low side terminals, with the AtverterH funcitioning as a buck converter.

### Maximum voltage and current limits:
The AtverterH board supports up to 60V, approximately 5A of maximum current on input and output. However, maximum sustained power transfer should be limited to **170W with active cooling** or below 100W without.

Voltage, current, and temperature limits can be adjusted in software to suit specific applications by modifying ```src/AtverterH_MPPT.cpp```.

## Web Interface
(docs/images/interface.jpg)

This web interface graphs recent voltage and current readings from the MPPT controller, allowing quick monitoring of system performance.

This interface reads and plots data from a ```data.json``` file located in the same directory as the ```index.html``` file.
This ```data.json``` file is generated by ```UART.py```, a Python script which communicates with the AtverterH over serial.

This ```UART.py``` script, as well as the web server itself, should both be configured to run at startup on the Raspberry Pi.

### Connecting AtverterH to Raspberry Pi
The serial connection between the AtverterH and the Raspberry Pi can be accomplished in a variety of ways, including a USB FTDI cable.

After this connection is made, the COM port can be set in ```UART.py```
