# AtverterE-Based MPPT Controller
<!-- (docs/interface.jpg) -->

This project consists of code for two primary components:
    * An MPPT controller program running on an AtverterE programmable DC-DC converter
    * A web interface displaying data from the MPPT controller, running on a Raspberry Pi 

## MPPT Controller
<!-- (docs/atverter.jpg) -->

The MPPT controller implements an incremental conductance (IC) algorithm running on an ATMEGA328p built into the AtverterE board.
For proper data to be read from this board, the calibration.cpp file must be flashed, and values for VL_scale, VL_offset, VH_scale, and VH_offset must be determined manually. These values can then be saved into their corresponding variables in the file ```/src/MPPT_wider_ranges_AVG_no_PID.cpp```.
This file must then be flashed to the ATMEGA chip for full MPPT operation.

This program was tested with a 24V solar panel on the high side terminals, and a 12V battery on the low side terminals, funcitioning as a buck converter.

Due to limitations of the AtverterE board, this MPPT program only implements low-side overvoltage protection in software, and over-current protection must be implemented in hardware, with in-line fuses or circuit breakers.

## Web Interface
<!-- (docs/interface.jpg) -->

This web interface graphs recent voltage and current readings from the MPPT controller, allowing quick monitoring of system performance.

This interface reads and plots data from a ```data.json``` file located in the same directory as the ```index.html``` file.
This ```data.json``` file is generated by ```UART.py```, a Python script which communicated with the AtverterE over serial.
